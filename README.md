# Office Flow Prototype

Frontend-only prototype for an office-rental marketplace.

## Stack
- Vite
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Fully mocked listings and mocked images

## Main flows
- Tenant flow: standard search, AI chat search, shortlist, booking request
- Owner flow: self-serve listing wizard, review and publish, lead pipeline snapshot

## Run
1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Start dev server:
   `npm run dev`
3. Build:
   `npm run build`

## Notes
- This environment had no npm network access, so dependencies were not installed here.
- All data is static and local in `src/data/mockData.js`.
